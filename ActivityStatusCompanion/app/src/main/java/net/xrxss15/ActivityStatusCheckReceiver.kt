/**
 * Tasker Integration Broadcast Receiver - Headless Mode Operation
 * 
 * This receiver handles trigger intents from Tasker and initiates headless background processing.
 * The app operates in two distinct modes:
 * 
 * - **Headless Mode**: When triggered by Tasker intent - no GUI, immediate background execution
 * - **Debug Mode**: When launched via MainActivity - full GUI with logging and testing
 * 
 * @see ConnectIQQueryWorker for the background processing implementation
 * @see MainActivity for debug mode UI
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - Receives broadcast intent from Tasker
 * - Enqueues WorkManager job for background processing
 * - No activity is launched - pure headless operation
 * - Complete app termination after reporting results via System.exit(0)
 * 
 * Battery Efficiency:
 * - Uses WorkManager with battery-aware constraints
 * - No unnecessary background services or polling
 * - Immediate termination after completion
